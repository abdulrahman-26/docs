## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I get a refund if I'm not satisfied?">
    As this is a digital service, all purchases are generally non-refundable once the service has been delivered or access has been granted.

    However, if you do not receive the promised features or goods (such as access to premium benefits), you may be eligible for a refund.\
    Please contact our support team within **7 days** of purchase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens when my premium expires?">
    If your premium plan expired, your saved settings and configurations will not be lost — we’ll keep them safe. However, your access will be limited to the features available in the free tier. This means some premium tools or options will no longer work until you upgrade again.

    You can reactivate your premium subscription anytime to instantly restore full access and continue where you left off.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I transfer premium between servers?">
    Premium subscriptions apply to individual servers. This means if you want premium features on multiple servers, each server will need its own separate premium subscription.
