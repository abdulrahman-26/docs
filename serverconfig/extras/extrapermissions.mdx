## Extra Permissions Overview

The extra permissions system allows server owners to grant elevated bot access to trusted users. Extra owners receive full bot permissions equivalent to the actual server owner, while extra admins get administrative access to most bot features.

### Permission Levels

<Steps>
  <Step title="Extra Owner">
    Full bot access identical to server owner - can manage all systems and moderate members
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extra Admin">
    Administrative access to most bot features with some restrictions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Standard User">
    Regular bot access based on Discord permissions
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Extra owners have complete bot control including the ability to **ban, kick, and manage all bot systems**. Only grant this to users you trust completely.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Extra permissions not working - Users cannot access elevated features">
    **Issue**: Users with extra permissions still cannot access restricted commands or features.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the user is properly added using `/extra owner show` or `/extra admin show`
    - Check if the bot has the necessary Discord permissions for the action
    - Ensure the user's Discord role hierarchy allows the intended action
    - Confirm the bot is online and functioning properly
    - Test with a simple elevated command to verify permission level
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot manage extra permissions - Permission denied">
    **Issue**: Getting permission errors when trying to add or remove extra permissions.

    **Solutions**:

    - Confirm you are the actual server owner
    - Verify the target user exists and is in the server
    - Check if you're using the correct user mention or ID format
    - Ensure the bot has proper permissions to manage server settings
    - Try refreshing Discord and attempting the command again
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Extra owners cannot moderate - Ban/kick commands failing">
    **Issue**: Extra owners cannot use moderation commands like ban or kick despite having permissions.

    **Solutions**:

    - Ensure the bot has "Ban Members" and "Kick Members" permissions
    - Check if the bot's role is higher than the target user's highest role
    - Verify the target user is not the actual server owner (cannot be moderated)
    - Confirm the extra owner permission is properly configured
    - Test moderation commands in different channels
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  Only the actual server owner can manage extra permissions. Extra owners cannot add or remove other extra owners/admins to prevent permission escalation conflicts.
