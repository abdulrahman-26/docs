## Ignore System Overview

The ignore system disables bot utility features (not automod/moderation/antinuke) in designated channels. This is useful for keeping certain channels free from bot interactions while still allowing trusted users to access commands when needed.

## System Setup

### Interactive Guide

View the complete ignore system setup guide.

```Unspecified Example
/ignore guide
```

### Quick Configuration Interface

Launch an interactive interface to manage ignore settings efficiently.

```Unspecified Example
/ignore interface
```

## Channel Management

### Adding Ignore Channels

Disable bot utility features in a specific channel.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/ignore channel add (channel)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/ignore channel add #general
/ignore channel add 123456789012345678
```

</CodeGroup>

### Removing Ignore Channels

Re-enable bot utility features in a previously ignored channel.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/ignore channel remove (channel)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/ignore channel remove #general
/ignore channel remove 123456789012345678
```

</CodeGroup>

### Viewing Ignored Channels

Display all channels where bot utility features are currently disabled.

```Unspecified Example
/ignore channel show
```

### Resetting All Ignored Channels

Remove all channels from the ignore list at once.

```Unspecified Example
/ignore channel reset
```

## User Exemption Management

### Adding Exempt Users

Allow specific users to use bot utility features even in ignored channels.

<Warning>
  This is a dangerous permission and will allow the user to entirely alter the ignore configuration.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/ignore bypass add (user)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/ignore bypass add @freycikkk
/ignore bypass add 123456789012345678
```

</CodeGroup>

### Removing Exempt Users

Remove exemption privileges from users, making them subject to channel restrictions.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/ignore bypass remove (user)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/ignore bypass remove @freycikkk
/ignore bypass remove 123456789012345678
```

</CodeGroup>

### Viewing Exempt Users

List all users who can bypass ignore channel restrictions.

```Unspecified Example
/ignore bypass show
```

### Resetting All Exempt Users

Remove exemption privileges from all users at once.

```Unspecified Example
/ignore bypass reset
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Commands still working in ignored channels">
    **Issue**: Bot utility features are still responding in channels marked as ignored.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the channel is properly added using `/ignore channel show`
    - Check if the user has exemption privileges with `/ignore bypass show`
    - Ensure you're testing utility commands, not moderation features
    - Confirm the bot has refreshed its configuration
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Exempt users cannot use commands">
    **Issue**: Users with exemption privileges still cannot access utility features in ignored channels.

    **Solutions**:

    - Confirm the user is properly added using `/ignore bypass show`
    - Check if the channel is actually in the ignore list
    - Verify the bot has proper permissions in the channel
    - Test with a simple utility command like `?ping`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="System not applying to new channels">
    **Issue**: Newly created channels aren't following ignore settings.

    **Solutions**:

    - Remember that channels must be manually added to the ignore list
    - Use `/ignore channel add` for each new channel you want to ignore
    - Check if channel permissions allow the bot to function properly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
  Moderation commands, automod, and antinuke features are NOT affected by the ignore system and will continue working in all channels for security purposes.
