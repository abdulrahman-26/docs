## No Prefix System Overview

The no prefix system allows designated users to execute bot commands without typing the traditional prefix (like `?`). Instead of typing `?afk`, users can simply type `afk` directly. This creates a more natural command experience while maintaining security through selective access.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Authorization">
    Server owners or extra owners grant no-prefix access to trusted members
  </Step>
  <Step title="Command Recognition">
    The bot automatically detects and processes commands without prefix for authorized users
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seamless Execution">
    Commands work exactly the same, just without the prefix requirement
  </Step>
  <Step title="Secure Access">
    Only explicitly authorized users can use this feature
  </Step>
</Steps>

## System Management

### Interactive Setup Guide

Access a comprehensive guide  for configuring the no prefix system.

```Unspecified Example
/guildnoprefix guide
```

### Quick Configuration Interface

Launch an interactive interface to easily manage no prefix settings and user permissions.

```Unspecified Example
/guildnoprefix interface
```

### Adding Users to No Prefix

Grant a user the ability to use commands without prefix. This is a powerful permission that should only be given to highly trusted members.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/guildnoprefix add (user)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/guildnoprefix add @freycikkk
/guildnoprefix add 123456789012345678
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Only server owners and extra owners can grant no-prefix access. This prevents unauthorized escalation of command privileges.
</Warning>

### Removing Users from No Prefix

Revoke a user's no-prefix privileges, requiring them to use the standard prefix again.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/guildnoprefix remove (user)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/guildnoprefix remove @freycikkk
/guildnoprefix remove 123456789012345678
```

</CodeGroup>

### Viewing Authorized Users

Display all users who currently have no-prefix access in your server.

```Unspecified Example
/guildnoprefix show
```

### Resetting No Prefix System

Remove all no-prefix permissions and reset the system completely.

```Unspecified Example
/guildnoprefix reset
```

## Command Examples

### Before No Prefix Access

```Unspecified Standard Usage
?afk Going to lunch
?userinfo @freycikkk
?weather New York
```

### After No Prefix Access

```Unspecified No Prefix Usage
afk Going to lunch
userinfo @freycikkk
weather New York
```

<Note>
  All bot functionality remains identical - only the prefix requirement is removed for authorized users. Commands still work with prefix if preferred.
</Note>

## Permission Requirements

### Who Can Manage No Prefix

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Server Owner">
    The original **server creator** has full access to grant and revoke no-prefix permissions
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extra Owner">
    Users designated as **Extra Owner** through the bot's permission system can also manage no-prefix access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Commands not working without prefix - User types command but nothing happens">
    **Issue**: Authorized users type commands without prefix but the bot doesn't respond.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the user is properly added using `/guildnoprefix show`
    - Check if the bot is online and functioning normally with prefixed commands
    - Ensure the command name is spelled correctly (e.g., `afk` not `away`)
    - Confirm the bot has permission to read messages in that channel
    - Test with a simple command like `ping` to verify no-prefix functionality
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot add users - Permission denied errors">
    **Issue**: Getting permission errors when trying to add users to the no-prefix system.

    **Solutions**:

    - Confirm you are the server owner or have "Extra Owner" permissions
    - Check if the target user exists and is in the server
    - Verify the bot has proper permissions to manage server settings
    - Ensure you're using the correct user mention or ID format
    - Try adding yourself first to test the system functionality
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conflicts with regular messages - Bot responding to normal conversation">
    **Issue**: The bot is treating regular messages as commands for no-prefix users.

    **Solutions**:

    - This shouldn't happen with proper bot configuration - report if it does
    - Check if the user is accidentally typing valid command names
    - Verify the bot isn't conflicting with other bots or auto-moderation
    - Consider temporarily removing no-prefix access while investigating
    - Review recent messages to identify the trigger pattern
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User still needs prefix - No-prefix not working after being added">
    **Issue**: Users added to the system still need to use prefix for commands.

    **Solutions**:

    - Double-check the user was successfully added with `/guildnoprefix show`
    - Ensure the user is trying commands in a channel where the bot has permissions
    - Verify the bot has been restarted or refreshed its permissions cache
    - Try removing and re-adding the user to refresh their permissions
    - Test with the user using a different command to isolate the issue
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="System reset issues - Cannot clear no-prefix permissions">
    **Issue**: The reset command isn't working or permissions persist after reset.

    **Solutions**:

    - Confirm you have proper permissions to reset the system
    - Try using `/guildnoprefix show` to verify the current state
    - Manually remove users one by one if reset fails
    - Check if there are any bot permission issues preventing database changes
    - Contact support if the system appears corrupted or unresponsive
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  If users report inconsistent behavior, have them try the same command with and without prefix to help identify the specific issue. The bot should work identically in both cases.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Remember that no-prefix access bypasses the visual indicator that a message is a bot command. Make sure authorized users understand the responsibility that comes with this privilege.
