## Autoresponder Setup

### Getting Started Guide

View a comprehensive guide on how to set up and use the autoresponder system effectively.

```Unspecified Example
/autoresponder guide
```

### Creating an Autoresponder

Create a new autoresponder by setting a trigger word or phrase. This opens the visual embed builder to customize your response message.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/autoresponder create (trigger)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/autoresponder create hey
```

</CodeGroup>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/autoresponder.png"
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
    className="mx-auto"
    alt="Autoresponder Embed Builder"
    title=""
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  To understand each button (e.g., **Content**, **Title**, **Footer**, etc.) and how variables work, visit the [Embed Builder](/link/to/embed-docs) page. _(Coming soon\!)_
</Tip>

### Editing an Autoresponder

Modify an existing autoresponder using its trigger word. This re-opens the interactive embed editor.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/autoresponder edit (trigger)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/autoresponder edit hey
```

</CodeGroup>

### Removing an Autoresponder

Delete a specific autoresponder using its trigger word.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/autoresponder remove (trigger)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/autoresponder remove hey
```

</CodeGroup>

### Enabling Auto-Delete

Set a time (between **5â€“60 seconds**) to automatically delete the autoresponder message after it is sent.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/autoresponder autodel (trigger) (time)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/autoresponder autodel hey 30
```

</CodeGroup>

### Viewing All Autoresponders

List all active autoresponder configurations for your server.

```Unspecified Example
/autoresponder config
```

### Resetting the Autoresponder System

Completely reset and remove all autoresponder setups.

```Unspecified Example
/autoresponder reset
```

    Use specific words that won't cause spam or false triggers

    Don't use words like "the", "and", or "is" as triggers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Autoresponder not triggering - No response to trigger words">
    **Issue**: The autoresponder is not responding when trigger words are used in chat.

    **Solutions**:

    - Check if the bot has "Send Messages" permission in the channel
    - Verify the trigger word is spelled correctly in your message
    - Ensure the autoresponder is properly configured using `/autoresponder config`
    - Check if the trigger type matches your message format
    - Confirm the bot is online and functioning
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Variables not working - Placeholders showing as text">
    **Issue**: Variables like `<<user:name>>` or `<<server:name>>` are displaying as plain text instead of actual values.

    **Solutions**:

    - Ensure proper variable syntax using `<<variable>>` format
    - Check for typos in variable names (e.g., `<<user:name>>` not `<<username>>`)
    - Verify you're using supported variables only
    - Make sure there are no extra spaces inside the angle brackets
    - Test with a simple variable like `<<user:name>>` first
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto-delete failing - Messages not being removed automatically">
    **Issue**: Autoresponder messages with auto-delete enabled are not being removed after the specified time.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the bot has "Manage Messages" permission in the channel
    - Check if the auto-delete time is within the valid range (5-60 seconds)
    - Ensure the message hasn't already been manually deleted
    - Confirm the bot's role hierarchy allows message management
    - Test with a longer auto-delete time to rule out timing issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Embed not displaying - Response appears as plain text">
    **Issue**: Autoresponder messages are showing as plain text instead of rich embeds.

    **Solutions**:

    - Confirm the bot has "Embed Links" permission in the channel
    - Check if the autoresponder was configured as an embed (not plain text)
    - Verify the embed content is properly formatted
    - Ensure the channel allows embeds (some channels may have restrictions)
    - Review embed builder configuration for any formatting errors
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  If the bot lacks proper permissions in channels, autoresponders will fail to trigger. Ensure the bot has necessary permissions across all channels where you want autoresponders to work.
