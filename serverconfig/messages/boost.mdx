## Boost Message Setup

### Creating a Boost Message

Use this command to create a new boost message by giving it a unique ID and selecting a target channel.\
It instantly opens a visual editor interface to customize your boost message, as shown below:

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/boost create (boost_id) (channel)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/boost create main #boosts
```

</CodeGroup>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/boostembed.png"
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
    className="mx-auto"
    alt="Boost Embed Builder"
    title=""
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  To understand each button (e.g., **Content**, **Title**, **Footer**, etc.) and how variables work, visit the [Embed Builder](/link/to/embed-docs) page. _(Coming soon\!)_
</Tip>

### Editing a Boost Embed

Edit the boost embed using its ID. This opens the visual embed builder, allowing you to customize the message.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/boost edit (boost_id)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/boost edit main
```

</CodeGroup>

### Removing a Boost Message

Delete a specific boost setup using its ID.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/boost remove (boost_id)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/boost remove main
```

</CodeGroup>

### Changing the Boost Channel

Change the channel where a specific boost embed will be sent.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/boost channel (boost_id) (channel)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/boost channel main #boosts
```

</CodeGroup>

### Enabling Auto-Delete

Automatically delete the boost message after a set time (between **5â€“60 seconds**).

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/boost autodel (boost_id) (time)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/boost autodel main 30
```

</CodeGroup>

### Testing a Boost Message

Send a test boost message to preview your configured embed.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/boost test (boost_id)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/boost test main
```

</CodeGroup>

### Viewing All Boost Configurations

Show all boost message setups currently active in your server.

```Unspecified Example
/boost show
```

### Resetting the Boost System

Remove **all** configured boost messages and reset the system.

```Unspecified Example
/boost reset
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Message not sending - Boost messages aren't being delivered">
    **Issue**: Boost messages are not appearing when members boost the server.

    **Solutions**:

    - Check if the bot has "Send Messages" permission in the target channel
    - Verify the bot can "View Channel" where boost messages should be sent
    - Ensure the boost system is properly enabled and configured
    - Confirm the target channel still exists and hasn't been deleted
    - Check if the bot is offline or experiencing connectivity issues
    - Verify the boost message ID is correctly configured
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Variables not working - Placeholders showing as text">
    **Issue**: Variables like `<<user:name>>` or `<<server:name>>` are displaying as plain text instead of actual values.

    **Solutions**:

    - Ensure proper variable syntax using `<<variable>>` format
    - Check for typos in variable names (e.g., `<<user:name>>` not `<<username>>`)
    - Verify you're using supported variables only
    - Make sure there are no extra spaces inside the angle brackets
    - Test with a simple variable like `<<user:name>>` first
    - Confirm the variable is supported in boost messages
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto-delete failing - Messages not being removed automatically">
    **Issue**: Boost messages with auto-delete enabled are not being removed after the specified time.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the bot has "Manage Messages" permission in the target channel
    - Check if the auto-delete time is within the valid range (5-60 seconds)
    - Ensure the message hasn't already been manually deleted
    - Confirm the bot's role hierarchy allows message management
    - Test with a longer auto-delete time to rule out timing issues
    - Verify auto-delete is properly configured for the specific boost ID
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Embed not displaying - Boost appears as plain text">
    **Issue**: Boost messages are showing as plain text instead of rich embeds.

    **Solutions**:

    - Confirm the bot has "Embed Links" permission in the target channel
    - Check if the boost message was configured as an embed (not plain text)
    - Verify the embed content is properly formatted
    - Ensure the channel allows embeds (some channels may have restrictions)
    - Test the embed using `/boost test` command with the specific boost ID
    - Review embed builder configuration for any formatting errors
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  If the bot lacks proper permissions in the target channel, the boost message will fail. Ensure the bot has necessary permissions before creating boost messages.
