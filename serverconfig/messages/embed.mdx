## Embed Message Creation

### Creating a Custom Embed

Use this command to open the interactive visual embed builder where you can design your custom embed message.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/embed create
```

</CodeGroup>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/embedbuilder.png"
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
    className="mx-auto"
    alt="Embed Builder Interface"
    title=""
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  The embed builder provides a real-time preview of your embed as you customize it. You can modify the title, description, color, fields, footer, and more through the intuitive interface.
</Tip>

## How It Works

The embed creation process follows these simple steps:

1. **Command Execution**: User types `/embed create`
2. **Builder Interface**: The bot opens an interactive embed builder with visual controls
3. **Customization**: User designs their embed using the available options (title, description, fields, colors, etc.)
4. **Save & Send**: Once the user presses **Save**, the bot prompts for destination
5. **Channel Selection**: Bot asks for channel. Please mention a channel or provide its ID
6. **Delivery**: User replies with a valid channel mention or ID, and the bot sends the embed

### Channel Selection Options

When prompted for the destination channel, you can respond with:

- Channel mention: `#general`
- Channel ID: `123456789012345678`

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Channel Mention
#announcements
```


```Unspecified Channel ID
987654321098765432
```

</CodeGroup>

## Advanced Features

### Embed Components

<Tip>
  To understand each component (e.g., **Content**, **Title**, **Footer**, etc.) and how variables work, visit the [Embed Builder](/link/to/embed-docs) page. _(Coming soon\!)_
</Tip>

### Formatting Support

Your embeds support rich text formatting including:

- **Bold text** using `**text**`
- _Italic text_ using `*text*`
- `Code blocks` using backticks
- [Hyperlinks](https://example.com) using `[text](url)`
- Line breaks and spacing

<Note>
  Embeds have character limits: titles (256 characters), descriptions (4096 characters), and field values (1024 characters). The builder will warn you if you exceed these limits.
</Note>

<Warning>
  If the bot lacks proper permissions in the target channel, the embed creation will fail. Ensure the bot has necessary permissions before creating embeds.
