## JoinDM Message Setup

### Setting Up JoinDM Messages

Use the setup command to configure and customize your JoinDM message for new members.
It instantly opens a visual editor interface to customize your direct message, similar to the welcome embed system.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/joindm setup
```

</CodeGroup>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/joindm.png"
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
    className="mx-auto"
    alt="JoinDM Message Builder"
    title=""
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  To understand each button (e.g., **Content**, **Title**, **Footer**, etc.) and how variables work, visit the [Embed Builder](/link/to/embed-docs) page. _(Coming soon\!)_
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/joindm autodel (time)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/joindm autodel 60

</CodeGroup>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="DM not sending - Messages aren't being delivered">
    **Issue**: JoinDM messages are not being sent to new members when they join the server.

    **Solutions**:

    - Check if new members have DMs enabled from server members
    - Verify the bot is online and functioning properly
    - Ensure the JoinDM system is properly enabled and configured
    - Check if the user has blocked the bot or disabled DMs
    - Test with an alternate account to confirm functionality
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Variables not working - Placeholders showing as text">
    **Issue**: Variables like `<<user:name>>` or `<<server:name>>` are displaying as plain text instead of actual values.

    **Solutions**:

    - Ensure proper variable syntax using `<<variable>>` format
    - Check for typos in variable names (e.g., `<<user:name>>` not `{username}`)
    - Verify you're using supported variables only
    - Make sure there are no extra spaces inside the brackets
    - Test with a simple variable like `<<user:name>>` first
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto-delete failing - Messages not being removed automatically">
    **Issue**: JoinDM messages with auto-delete enabled are not being removed after the specified time.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the auto-delete time is within the valid range (5-300 seconds)
    - Check if the user has deleted the DM conversation
    - Ensure the user hasn't left the server before auto-delete triggers
    - Test with a longer auto-delete time to rule out timing issues
    - Remember that deleted DM conversations cannot be auto-deleted
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Embed not displaying - JoinDM appears as plain text">
    **Issue**: JoinDM messages are showing as plain text instead of rich embeds.

    **Solutions**:

    - Confirm the JoinDM message was configured as an embed (not plain text)
    - Verify the embed content is properly formatted
    - Check if the user's client supports embeds in DMs
    - Test the embed using `/joindm test` command
    - Ensure embed content doesn't exceed Discord's character limits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Privacy concerns - Users complaining about unsolicited DMs">
    **Issue**: New members are concerned about receiving direct messages from the bot.

    **Solutions**:

    - Consider adding a notice in your welcome channel about JoinDM messages
    - Keep JoinDM messages helpful and informative, not promotional
    - Provide clear instructions on how users can disable DMs if desired
    - Make sure your server rules mention automated DM messages
    - Consider using auto-delete to reduce DM clutter
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  JoinDM messages are sent directly to users and cannot be controlled by channel permissions. Ensure your messages are welcoming and informative to avoid being perceived as spam.
