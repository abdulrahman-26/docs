## Sticky Message Setup

### Getting Started Guide

View a comprehensive guide on how to set up and use the sticky message system effectively.

```Unspecified Example
/sticky guide
```

### Creating a Sticky Message

Create a new sticky message by assigning it an ID and selecting a target channel. This opens the visual embed builder to customize your sticky message.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/sticky create (sticky_id) (channel)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/sticky create rules #general
```

</CodeGroup>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/stickyembed.png"
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
    className="mx-auto"
    alt="Sticky Message Embed Builder"
    title=""
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  To understand each button (e.g., **Content**, **Title**, **Footer**, etc.) and how variables work, visit the [Embed Builder](/link/to/embed-docs) page. _(Coming soon\!)_
</Tip>

### Editing a Sticky Message

Modify an existing sticky message using its ID. This re-opens the interactive embed editor.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/sticky edit (sticky_id)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/sticky edit rules
```

</CodeGroup>

### Removing a Sticky Message

Delete a specific sticky message using its ID.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/sticky remove (sticky_id)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/sticky remove rules
```

</CodeGroup>

### Changing the Sticky Channel

Change the channel where a specific sticky message will appear.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/sticky channel (sticky_id) (channel)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/sticky channel rules #announcements
```

</CodeGroup>

### Viewing All Sticky Messages

List all active sticky message configurations for your server.

```Unspecified Example
/sticky show
```

### Resetting the Sticky System

Completely reset and remove all sticky message setups.

```Unspecified Example
/sticky reset
```

<Note>
  Sticky messages only reappear when regular users send messages. Bot messages and commands typically don't trigger the sticky system to avoid spam.

    Use only one sticky message per channel to avoid clutter

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sticky not appearing - Messages aren't staying pinned">
    **Issue**: The sticky message is not reappearing when new messages are sent in the channel.

    **Solutions**:

    - Check if the bot has "Send Messages" permission in the target channel
    - Verify the bot has "Manage Messages" permission to delete old sticky messages
    - Ensure the sticky message is properly configured using `/sticky show`
    - Confirm the target channel still exists and hasn't been deleted
    - Check if the bot is online and functioning properly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Variables not working - Placeholders showing as text">
    **Issue**: Variables like `<<user:name>>` or `<<server:name>>` are displaying as plain text instead of actual values.

    **Solutions**:

    - Ensure proper variable syntax using `<<variable>>` format
    - Check for typos in variable names (e.g., `<<server:name>>` not `<<servername>>`)
    - Verify you're using supported variables only
    - Make sure there are no extra spaces inside the angle brackets
    - Test with a simple variable like `<<server:name>>` first
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multiple sticky messages appearing - Duplicates in channel">
    **Issue**: Multiple copies of the sticky message are appearing instead of replacing the previous one.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the bot has "Manage Messages" permission to delete old messages
    - Check if there are conflicting sticky setups with the same ID
    - Ensure the bot's role hierarchy allows message management
    - Try resetting and recreating the sticky message
    - Manually delete duplicate messages and test again
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Embed not displaying - Sticky appears as plain text">
    **Issue**: Sticky messages are showing as plain text instead of rich embeds.

    **Solutions**:

    - Confirm the bot has "Embed Links" permission in the target channel
    - Check if the sticky message was configured as an embed (not plain text)
    - Verify the embed content is properly formatted
    - Ensure the channel allows embeds (some channels may have restrictions)
    - Review embed builder configuration for any formatting errors
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  If the bot lacks "Manage Messages" permission, sticky messages will accumulate instead of replacing each other. Ensure proper permissions before creating sticky messages.
