## Welcome Message Setup

### Creating a Welcome Message

Use the create command to register a new welcome message by assigning it an ID and a target channel.
It instantly opens a visual editor interface to customize your welcome message, as shown below:

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/welcome create (welcome_id) (channel)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/welcome create main #general
```

</CodeGroup>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/welcomeembed.png"
    style={{ width:"100%" }}
    className="mx-auto"
    alt="Welcome Embed Builder"
    title=""
  />
</Frame>

<Tip>
  To understand each button (e.g., **Content**, **Title**, **Footer**, etc.) and how variables work, visit the [Embed Builder](/link/to/embed-docs) page. _(Coming soon\!)_
</Tip>

### Editing a Welcome Embed

Modify an existing welcome embed using its ID. This re-opens the same interactive embed editor.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/welcome edit (welcome_id)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/welcome edit main
```

</CodeGroup>

### Removing a Welcome Message

Delete a specific welcome setup using its ID.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/welcome remove (welcome_id)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/welcome remove main
```

</CodeGroup>

### Changing the Welcome Channel

Change the target channel of a welcome embed using its ID.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/welcome channel (welcome_id) (channel)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/welcome channel main #welcome
```

</CodeGroup>

### Enabling Auto-Delete

Set a time (between **5â€“60 seconds**) to automatically delete the welcome message after it is sent.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/welcome autodel (welcome_id) (time)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/welcome autodel main 30
```

</CodeGroup>

### Testing a Welcome Message

Send a test welcome message to preview the selected configuration.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/welcome test (welcome_id)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/welcome test main
```

</CodeGroup>

### Viewing All Welcome Configurations

List all active welcome message setups for your server.

```Unspecified Example
/welcome show
```

### Resetting the Welcome System

Completely reset and remove all welcome setups.

```Unspecified Example
/welcome reset
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Welcome not sending - Messages aren't being delivered">
    **Issue**: Welcome messages are not appearing when new members join the server.

    **Solutions**:

    - Check if the bot has "Send Messages" permission in the target channel
    - Verify the bot can "View Channel" where welcome messages should be sent
    - Ensure the welcome system is properly enabled and configured
    - Confirm the target channel still exists and hasn't been deleted
    - Check if the bot is offline or experiencing connectivity issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Variables not working - Placeholders showing as text">
    **Issue**: Variables like `<<user:name>>` or `<<server:name>>` are displaying as plain text instead of actual values.

    **Solutions**:

    - Ensure proper variable syntax using `<<variable>>` format
    - Check for typos in variable names (e.g., `<<user:name>>` not `{username}`)
    - Verify you're using supported variables only
    - Make sure there are no extra spaces inside the brackets
    - Test with a simple variable like `<<user:name>>` first
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Auto-delete failing - Messages not being removed automatically">
    **Issue**: Welcome messages with auto-delete enabled are not being removed after the specified time.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the bot has "Manage Messages" permission in the target channel
    - Check if the auto-delete time is within the valid range (5-60 seconds)
    - Ensure the message hasn't already been manually deleted
    - Confirm the bot's role hierarchy allows message management
    - Test with a longer auto-delete time to rule out timing issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Embed not displaying - Welcome appears as plain text">
    **Issue**: Welcome messages are showing as plain text instead of rich embeds.

    **Solutions**:

    - Confirm the bot has "Embed Links" permission in the target channel
    - Check if the welcome message was configured as an embed (not plain text)
    - Verify the embed content is properly formatted
    - Ensure the channel allows embeds (some channels may have restrictions)
    - Test the embed using `/welcome test` command
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  If the bot lacks proper permissions in the target channel, the welcome message will fail. Ensure the bot has necessary permissions before creating welcome messages.
