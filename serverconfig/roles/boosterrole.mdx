## System Features

### Base Role Support

Keep your server organized with intelligent role stacking. All booster roles are positioned above your designated base role, maintaining hierarchy while giving boosters their custom appearance.

<Note>
  Set a base role to keep booster roles organized in your server's role list. This is especially useful for servers with extensive role systems.
</Note>

### Blacklist Management

Maintain control over who can create booster roles with comprehensive blacklist features.

**Blacklist Controls:**

- Add problematic users to prevent abuse
- Remove users from blacklist when appropriate
- View complete blacklist for transparency
- Reset entire blacklist for fresh starts

### Auto-Expiration System

Booster roles are automatically managed based on boost status:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Active Boosters">
    Maintains role permissions and customization options for active server boosters
  </Card>
  <Card title="Expired Boosts">
    Automatically removes custom roles when members stop boosting the server
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Server Level Integration

  </Card>
  <Card title="Level 2+ Servers">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Role Limitations

<Warning>
  Each booster can only create **one custom role** to prevent server clutter and maintain organization. This limitation ensures the system remains manageable and doesn't overwhelm your role list.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Boosters can't create roles - Permission issues">
    **Issue**: Server boosters receive errors when trying to create custom roles.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the bot has "Manage Roles" permission in server settings
    - Check if the bot's role is positioned above the base role in hierarchy
    - Confirm the user is actually boosting the server (not expired)
    - Ensure the user isn't on the blacklist using Show â†’ Blacklist
    - Test with a different booster to isolate user-specific issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Roles not positioning correctly - Base role issues">
    **Issue**: Booster roles appear in wrong positions or don't stack under base role.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify base role is properly set in Admin â†’ Base Role Interface
    - Check bot role hierarchy - bot must be above booster roles
    - Ensure base role exists and hasn't been deleted
    - Test base role positioning by creating a new booster role
    - Review server role list to confirm proper stacking above base role
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Icons not working - Server level restrictions">
    **Issue**: Boosters cannot add emoji icons to their custom roles.

    **Solutions**:

    - Confirm your server is Level 2 or higher for emoji role icons
    - Check if the emoji exists and is accessible in your server
    - Verify the emoji isn't from another server (use server-specific emojis)
    - Test with basic Unicode emojis instead of custom ones
    - Ensure the bot has permission to manage role icons
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Expired roles not deleting - Auto-cleanup failing">
    **Issue**: Custom roles remain after members stop boosting.

    **Solutions**:

    - Check if the bot is online to monitor boost status changes
    - Verify the bot has permissions to delete roles
    - Manually check boost status of users with existing roles
    - Use Admin â†’ Show â†’ List to review current booster roles
    - Consider manually cleaning up expired roles if needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Blacklist not working - Users bypassing restrictions">
    **Issue**: Blacklisted users can still create or modify booster roles.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify users are properly added to blacklist using Show â†’ Blacklist
    - Check spelling of usernames or use user IDs for accuracy
    - Ensure blacklist feature is enabled in system configuration
    - Test blacklist by having a blacklisted user attempt role creation
    - Review recent blacklist changes for any accidental removals
  </Accordion>

## Integration with Server Systems

### Role Hierarchy Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Administrative Roles">
    Keep admin and moderation roles above the base role
  </Card>
  <Card title="Special Roles">
    Position important server roles strategically around booster roles
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bot Positioning">
    Ensure bot role is high enough to manage all booster roles
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clean Organization">
    Use base role to create clear separation in your role list
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Premium Integration

<Note>
  The Booster Role system works seamlessly with other features. Consider combining it with Voice Roles, Custom Roles, or other server configuration options for enhanced server experience.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Booster roles are automatically managed by boost status. Manual role assignments may be overwritten by the system when boost status changes. Use the administrative interface for any necessary manual interventions.
