description: "The custom roles system allows you to create custom commands for role assignment. Set up shortcut commands that authorized users can use to toggle roles on/off for members, creating an efficient role management system with custom names and requirements."

## Custom Roles System Overview

The custom roles system lets you create personalized commands for role management. Instead of using complex role assignment commands, you can create simple shortcuts like `vip @user` or `premium @member` that will automatically toggle roles on or off.

### How It Works

1. **Setup**: Create custom role commands with unique names
2. **Usage**: Use `commandname @user` OR reply to a message with `commandname`
3. **Toggle**: Adds role if user doesn't have it, removes if they do
4. **Requirements**: Set requirement roles to control who can use commands

## Custom Roles Configuration

### Viewing Custom Roles Configuration

Display all current custom role commands and their settings.

```Unspecified Example
/setup guide
```

### Creating Custom Role Commands

Create a new custom role command with a unique name and associated role.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/setup add (name) (role)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/setup add vip @VIP-Member
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  After setup, authorized users can use: `vip @username` to toggle the VIP-Member role on/off for that user.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Roles with dangerous permissions (**Kick, Ban, Manage Server, Administrator**) cannot be added. Be careful with reply method - **replying** with a command gives the role to whoever you replied to\!
</Warning>

### Removing Custom Role Commands

Delete a custom role command by its name.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/setup remove (name)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/setup remove vip
```

</CodeGroup>

### Setting Requirement Roles

Configure which role is required to use custom role commands. Only users with this role or Extra Owners can execute the custom commands.

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Example
/setup reqrole (role)
```


```Unspecified Syntax
/setup reqrole @Moderator
```

</CodeGroup>

### Viewing Current Setup

Display all active custom roles and requirement settings.

```Unspecified Example
/setup show
```

### Resetting Custom Roles System

Remove all custom role commands and reset the requirement role settings.

```Unspecified Example
/setup reset
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Setup & Usage

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Setup
/setup add vip @VIP-Member
```


```Unspecified Usage
vip @john_doe
```


```Unspecified Reply Method
Reply to someone's message with: vip
```

</CodeGroup>

**Result**: Toggles VIP-Member role on/off

### With Requirement Role

<CodeGroup>

```Unspecified Setup
/setup reqrole @Staff
/setup add premium @Premium-User
```


```Unspecified Usage
premium @user
```

</CodeGroup>

**Result**: Only @Staff members can use the premium command

## Use Cases & Examples

### Staff Management

- **Command**: `staff @user` → **Role**: @Staff-Member
- **Command**: `mod @user` → **Role**: @Moderator

### Community Roles

- **Command**: `artist @user` → **Role**: @Community-Artist
- **Command**: `helper @user` → **Role**: @Community-Helper

### Special Access

- **Command**: `vip @user` → **Role**: @VIP-Access
- **Command**: `beta @user` → **Role**: @Beta-Tester

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom commands not working - Commands not responding">
    **Issue**: Custom role commands are not responding when used by authorized users.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the custom role command exists using `/setup show`
    - Check if the user has the required role set by `/setup reqrole`
    - Ensure the bot has "Manage Roles" permission in the server.
    - Confirm the role name is spelled correctly.
    - Test with a different user who has the requirement role
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Permission denied - Users can't use custom commands">
    **Issue**: Users are getting permission errors when trying to use custom role commands.

    **Solutions**:

    - Check if a requirement role is set using `/setup guide`
    - Verify the user has the required role to use custom commands
    - Ensure the requirement role hasn't been deleted or renamed
    - Consider if the requirement role is too restrictive for your needs
    - Test by temporarily removing the requirement role restriction
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Role assignment failing - Custom commands run but roles don't change">
    **Issue**: Custom commands execute but the target user's roles don't get modified.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the bot's role is positioned higher than the target role in hierarchy
    - Check if the bot has "Manage Roles" permission
    - Ensure the target role still exists and hasn't been deleted
    - Confirm the target user can receive the role (not hitting role limits)
    - Test the role assignment manually to isolate the issue
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Toggle not working - Roles only being added, not removed">
    **Issue**: Custom commands add roles but don't remove them when the user already has the role.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the bot can detect existing roles on the target user
    - Check if multiple roles with similar names are causing confusion
    - Ensure the bot has permission to remove roles from users
    - Test the toggle functionality with a simple role first
    - Confirm the role hierarchy allows the bot to remove the specific role
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Command conflicts - Custom commands interfering with other bots">
    **Issue**: Custom role commands are conflicting with other bot commands or systems.

    **Solutions**:

    - Choose unique command names that don't conflict with other bots
    - Check if other bots are using the same command triggers
    - Consider adding a prefix or unique identifier to your custom commands
    - Review command priorities if multiple bots respond to the same trigger
    - Test custom commands in a channel where other bots are restricted
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Accidental role assignments - Wrong users getting roles through replies">
    **Issue**: Users are accidentally getting roles when someone replies to their message with a custom command.

    **Solutions**:

    - Train authorized users to be careful when using reply-based role assignment
    - Consider if the reply method is necessary for your server's workflow
    - Use direct mentions (@user) instead of replies when precision is important
    - Monitor role assignments and undo accidental assignments quickly
    - Consider restricting custom role usage to specific channels to reduce accidents
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Dangerous roles blocked - Can't add moderation roles to custom commands">
    **Issue**: The system prevents adding roles with dangerous permissions to custom role commands.

    **Solutions**:

    - This is intentional security behavior - roles with kick, ban, manage server, or administrator permissions cannot be added
    - Create separate roles without dangerous permissions for the custom role system
    - Use Discord's built-in role management for roles requiring moderation permissions
    - Consider creating "honorary" or "display" versions of staff roles without actual permissions and connect them together with our [Role Connection System](/serverconfig/roles/connectionrole)
    - Contact administrators if you need moderation roles managed through different systems
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Custom commands bypass normal permissions. Set requirement roles properly and be careful with the reply method - it gives roles to whoever you replied to\!
