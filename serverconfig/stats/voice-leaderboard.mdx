## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Voice time not tracking - Leaderboard not updating">
    **Issue**: The voice leaderboard shows outdated information or doesn't track recent voice activity.

    **Solutions**:

    - Ensure the bot has permission to view voice channels
    - Check if the bot can see voice state changes in server settings
    - Verify the bot is online when users join/leave voice channels
    - Test by joining a voice channel and checking if time updates
    - Confirm voice tracking isn't disabled in bot settings
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cannot modify voice time - Permission errors">
    **Issue**: Getting permission denied when trying to add, remove, or set voice time.

    **Solutions**:

    - Confirm you have administrator permissions or extra owner/admin status
    - Verify the target user exists and is in the server
    - Check if you're using the correct user mention or ID format
    - Ensure the timeframe parameter is spelled correctly (daily/weekly/monthly/all-time)
    - Try with a smaller number to test if there are value limits
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Leaderboard frame not displaying - Visual issues">
    **Issue**: The voice leaderboard command returns text instead of the styled frame image.

    **Solutions**:

    - Ensure the bot has "Attach Files" permission in the channel
    - Check if the bot has "Embed Links" permission for proper display
    - Verify your internet connection for loading the leaderboard frame
    - Try using the command in a different channel
    - Check if there are any channel-specific restrictions on bot images
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AFK voice time counting - Inactive users getting time">
    **Issue**: Users who are AFK or muted in voice channels are still accumulating voice time.

    **Solutions**:

    - This is normal behavior - voice time tracks presence, not activity
    - Use manual adjustments to correct time if needed for fairness
    - Consider setting server AFK timeouts to minimize inactive tracking
    - Review voice time manually for competitions or rewards
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  Manual voice time adjustments affect leaderboard rankings and statistics. Use these commands responsibly and only when necessary for moderation or data correction purposes.
