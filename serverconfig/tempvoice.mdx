## Temporary Voice Channels Overview

The temporary voice channels system allows members to create their own customizable voice channels on-demand. When users join the **Join to Create** channel, a new temporary voice channel is automatically created for them with full customization options.

### How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Join to Create">
    Members join a designated voice channel to trigger creation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-Creation">
    A new temporary voice channel is instantly created for the user
  </Step>
  <Step title="Interface Control">
    Members use an interface channel with buttons to customize their channel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-Deletion">
    Temporary channels are automatically deleted when empty
  </Step>
</Steps>

## System Setup

## System Components

### Interface Channel

The interface channel contains an embed with customization buttons that allow channel owners to modify their temporary voice channels. **This channel should be locked** to keep the embed message visible at the top.

### Join to Create Channel

The **Join to Create** channel is where members join to automatically create their temporary voice channel. This channel is **required** for the VoiceMaster system to function properly.

**Features:**

- Automatic channel creation on join
- Instant ownership assignment
- Auto-deletion when empty

## Integration with Voice Roles

You can configure [Voice Roles](/serverconfig/roles/voicerole) to automatically assign roles to members when they join any voice channel, including temporary ones.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Channels not creating - Join to Create not working">
    **Issue**: Members join the Join to Create channel but no temporary channel is created.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the bot has "Manage Channels" permission in the server
    - Ensure the bot has "Move Members" permission to move users to new channels
    - Check if the Join to Create channel is properly configured in settings
    - Confirm the bot's role is high enough in hierarchy to create channels
    - Test with a different user to rule out user-specific issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Interface not responding - Buttons not working">
    **Issue**: The interface embed buttons are not responding when clicked.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the interface channel is properly set up using `?tempvoice show`
    - Check if the embed message still exists and hasn't been deleted
    - Ensure the bot has "Send Messages" and "Embed Links" permissions in interface channel
    - Confirm the user owns a temporary voice channel before using interface
    - Try refreshing Discord or using the interface from a different device
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Channels not deleting - Empty channels remain">
    **Issue**: Temporary voice channels are not being automatically deleted when empty.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the bot is monitoring voice state changes properly
    - Check if the bot has "Manage Channels" permission to delete channels
    - Ensure the bot is online and functioning when users leave channels
    - Confirm no other bots or systems are keeping the channels active
    - Test by creating and leaving a temporary channel to verify auto-deletion
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Permission errors - Users can't customize channels">
    **Issue**: Channel owners cannot modify their temporary voice channels through the interface.

    **Solutions**:

    - Verify the bot has necessary permissions (Manage Channels, Manage Permissions)
    - Check if the user is the actual owner of the temporary channel
    - Ensure the bot's role hierarchy allows channel management
    - Confirm the temporary channel hasn't been manually modified by administrators
    - Test interface controls one by one to identify specific permission issues
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Interface channel issues - Embed getting buried or deleted">
    **Issue**: The interface embed message is not visible or gets pushed down by other messages.

    **Solutions**:

    - Lock the interface channel to prevent members from sending messages
    - Remove unnecessary permissions for @everyone in the interface channel
    - Pin the interface embed message if it gets buried
    - Consider using a dedicated category for temporary voice system channels
    - Regularly monitor and maintain the interface channel organization
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
  The Join to Create channel is essential for the system to function. Ensure the bot has "Manage Channels" and "Move Members" permissions, and keep the interface channel locked to maintain the embed visibility.
